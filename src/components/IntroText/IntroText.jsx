                    Mass Global Disappearance
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This site is here as a resource to those who are left behind
                    after the mass disappearance. I'm not sure how they will say
                    it happened, some theories say that it will be alien
                    abduction, other people say it will be some kind of virus
                    tha kills people. Either way, they are lying.

                    This mass vanishing of people is an event called the
                    "rapture" which is written about in the Bible. If you're not
                    religious, this will sound insane and like a made up story.
                    This is why I put this site together, to show you, step by
                    step what is coming, and when you've seen it for yourself,
                    my hope is that you will see the truth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might be here before this event though as we don't know
                    when it's coming. Maybe someone sent you here because they
                    want you to gain more knowledge, maybe they're hoping you'll
                    be saved.. Whatever brought you here wants better things for
                    you. At the bottom of the page you will find the Gospel.
                    This is THE MOST IMPORTANT PART so if you're not interested
                    in the timeline, just skip to that part, read it and
                    hopefully it will get you thinking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope this site helps you in some way, even if its just to
                    get you to think outside the box for a minute. Either way, I
                    hope you find what you're looking for.
