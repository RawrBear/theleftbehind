# The Left Behind

**Desctiption:**
This site is built with the aim of getting people to God during the Tribulation. This is to stop them ending up in the lake of fire at the end of the milenial reign. The "Left Behind" are the people that were not saved before the rapture and will have to suffer God's wrath. Hopefully people will see this site, match up what it says with how the world is and see that God is real. Once they are saved, they will have a place in heaven for eternity.
